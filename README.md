# Issues-I-had-when-Installing-Matconvent-Python
Issues I experinced when I was trying to install VOT+Matconvent + Python


+ Visual Studio 2017 doesnt work with Matlab 2017b in case of installing Matconvent
+ Instead use VS2015

+ Dont forget to add CUDNN to CUDA9.0
+ Becarful after you add CUDNN python doesnt work.

+ To explore which compiler you want to use (VS2017, VS2015) in case you have both just type in matab  mex -setup 
  it allows you to choose one.
